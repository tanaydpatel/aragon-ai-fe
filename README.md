# Task management app

## Setup instructions

- Verify you've node 18+. Suggested version 20.9.0
- Run `npm install`
- To start the frontend run `npm run dev`

## Objectives of project

Your users should be able to:

- Create, read, update, and delete boards and tasks
- There should be frontend form validations when trying to create/edit boards and tasks
- Use state management on frontend (i.e. react hooks)
- Hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Use the optimal responsive layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- You should not use any external component library. Everything should be using react components.
- Connect the frontend to a backend node.js app. You should be able to store and retrieve data via an api
- Well thought out tables in the database that follow good system design.
- You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. But recommended tech stack is to use react.js/next.js, typescript, postgres, and node.js

## Implementation

- Used React Js to develop the UI components
- Axios for data fetching
- Redux Js for maintaing state across various components
